# Privacy Policy for ChatterinoWatch

## Introduction

ChatterinoWatch is a browser extension designed to enhance the Chatterino experience by automatically detecting the currently active Twitch channel and reporting it to Chatterino. This extension is built with user privacy in mind and does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

## Data Collection and Usage

- ChatterinoWatch **does not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.
- The extension only reads the **active Twitch channel** from the browserâ€™s address bar and sends it to Chatterino.
- It **does not** modify webpage content, track browsing history, or interact with any other websites.

## Permissions Justification

To function correctly, ChatterinoWatch requires the following permissions:

- **Host Permission (`https://www.twitch.tv/*`)**: This is necessary to detect the Twitch channel being watched and send it to Chatterino.
- **Native Messaging**: This is required for communication between the browser extension and the Chatterino application.
- **Tabs Permission**: This is required to detect when the user switches between Twitch channels or changes their active tab, ensuring real-time updates to Chatterino.
- **Storage Permission**: This may be required in future updates to store small configuration settings, but no user data is stored or transmitted.

## Open-Source Transparency

ChatterinoWatch is **fully open-source**, and its source code is publicly available for review. Anyone can inspect how it operates to verify that no personal data is collected.

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out via the project's official repository or communication channels.
